This file contains the files matrix.mtx, features.tsv, and barcode.tsv, which describe feature-barcode matrices as output. The Read10X() function steps read this output pipeline. 'dplyr' package is attached. 'package:stats' masks the following objects: filter, lag 'package:base' masks the following objects: intersect, setdiff, setequal, union. Adding a library Object Seurat,Patchwork,Dplyr Open the PBMC dataset. Fill the Seurat object with raw data (non-normalized data). Underlines ('_') must be replaced with dashes in feature names. Within a single assay, an object of class Seurat 13714 appears in 2700 samples. RNA active assay (13714 features, 0 variable features) sparse 50 x 10 "dgCMatrix" class matrix [[10 column names suppressed: 'AAACATACAACCAC-1,' 'AAACATTGAGCTAC-1,' 'AAACATTGATCAGC-1...]] Visualize quality control metrics as a violin plot. FeatureScatter is typically used to visualise feature-feature relationships, but it can also be used for other purposes.
